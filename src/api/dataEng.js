    "UTA Group Companies serves a few types of customers. The first customer group consists of medium-sized foreign construction companies that, due to the high costs associated with their projects, do not establish their own purchasing, logistics, and operations departments and have limited experience in export and import. We provide these companies with services similar to their purchasing, logistics, and operations departments, which is much more economical for them than building their own teams. These services include project measurement, translation, storage, loading, purchasing, transportation, certification procurement, and export. Our second customer group includes multinational corporations or corporate firms that experience problems in the procurement process due to existing procedures and restrictions in the countries where trade is conducted. Through our company, both secure trade and monitoring of every stage are ensured.",
